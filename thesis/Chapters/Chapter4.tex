In these chapter we raises bridges between Category Theory, Lambda calculus, and Propositional logic. These will provide a good principle, {\color{red} finish this intro after writing the chapter}. 


\section{Property oriented Propositional Logic}
In this section we briefly introduce the notation and rudiments of propositional logic, in order to work with it further in the
