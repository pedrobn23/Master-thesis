# Master-thesis
Repository for my master thesis - Work in progress. I usually forget to put in here the updates so don't trust me.

## Current State

Here I will be updating when each section state:

- Chapter 1: 
  - Ready.
  
- Chapter 2: 
  - Some examples are left to do.

- Chapter 3:
  - Untyped lambda calculus is mostly done.
	- Curry's paradox is left to do.
  - Typed lambda calculus is to do.
  
  
- Thinks that will be add:
  - Curry-Howard-Lambeck isomorphism.
  - Dependent typing.

## Acknowledges
Thanks a lot to Ángel González-Prieto for supervising this work. 

## If you want to help
- Just reading and telling me whether everything is understandable and well written is more than enough. :)
- Funny example, specially category theory examples, are **always** well received.
